# RAG Reference Architecture using LLaMA Stack, OpenShift AI, and PGVector

## Description

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant external knowledge to improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and support domain-specific conversations. This architecture uses:

- **OpenShift AI** for orchestration
- **LLaMA Stack** for standardizing the core building blocks and simplifying AI application development
- **PGVector** for semantic search
- **Kubeflow Pipelines** for data ingestion
- **Streamlit UI** for a user-friendly chatbot interface

*The architecture illustrates both the ingestion pipeline for document processing and the RAG pipeline for query handling. For more details click [here](docs/rag-reference-architecture.md).*

---

## Features

- Multi-Modal Data Ingestion for ingesting unstructured data
- Preprocessing pipelines for cleaning, chunking, and embedding generation using language models
- Vector Store Integration to store dense embeddings
- Integrates with LLMs to generate responses based on retrieved documents
- Streamlit based web application
- Runs on OpenShift AI for container orchestration and GPU acceleration
- Llama Stack to standardize the core building blocks and simplify AI application development
- Safety Guardrail to block harmful request / response
- Integration with MCP servers

---

## Ingestion Use Cases

### 1. BYOD (Bring Your Own Document)

End users can upload files through a UI and receive contextual answers based on uploaded content.

### 2. Pre-Ingestion

Enterprise documents are pre-processed and ingested into the system for later querying via OpenShift AI/Kubeflow Pipelines.

#### Installation steps

1. Clone the repo so you have a working copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/RAG-Blueprint
```

2. Login to your OpenShift Cluster

```bash
oc login --server="<cluster-api-endpoint>" --token="sha256~XYZ"
```

3. If the GPU nodes are tainted, find the taint key. You will have to pass in the
   make command to ensure that the llm pods are deployed on the tainted nodes with GPU.
   In the example below the key for the taint is `nvidia.com/gpu`


```bash
oc get nodes -l nvidia.com/gpu.present=true -o yaml | grep -A 3 taint 
```
The output of the command will be something like below
```
  taints:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: nvidia.com/gpu
      value: "true"
--
    taints:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: nvidia.com/gpu
      value: "true"
```

You can work with your OpenShift cluster admin team to determine what labels and taints identify GPU-enabled worker nodes.  It is also possible that all your worker nodes have GPUs therefore have no distinguishing taint.

4. Navigate to Helm deploy directory

```bash
cd deploy/helm
```

5. List available models

```bash
make list-models
```

The above command will list the models to use in the next command

```bash
(Output)
model: llama-3-1-8b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
model: llama-3-2-1b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct)
model: llama-3-2-3b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct)
model: llama-3-3-70b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct)
model: llama-guard-3-1b (meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-1B)
model: llama-guard-3-8b (meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B)
```

The "guard" models can be used to test shields for profanity, hate speech, violence, etc.

6. Install via make

Use the taint key from above as the `LLM_TOLERATION` and `SAFETY_TOLERATION`

The namespace will be auto-created

To install only the RAG example, no shields, use the following command:

```bash
make install NAMESPACE=llama-stack-rag LLM=llama-3-2-3b-instruct LLM_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu"
```

To install both the RAG example as well as the guard model to allow for shields, use the following command:

```bash
make install NAMESPACE=llama-stack-rag LLM=llama-3-2-3b-instruct LLM_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu" SAFETY=llama-guard-3-8b SAFETY_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu"
```

If you have no tainted nodes, perhaps every worker node has a GPU, then you can use a simplified version of the make command

```bash
make install NAMESPACE=llama-stack-rag LLM=llama-3-2-3b-instruct SAFETY=llama-guard-3-8b
```

When prompted, enter your **[Hugging Face Token]((https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens))**.

Note: This process often takes 11 to 30 minutes

7. Watch/Monitor

```bash
oc get pods -n llama-stack-rag
```

```

2. Click on RAG

3. Upload your document

4. Create a Vector Database

![RAG UI Main 2](./docs/img/rag-ui-2.png)

5. Once you've recieved `Vector database created successfully!`, select the Vector Database you created

6. Ask a question pertaining to your document!

![RAG UI Main 3](./docs/img/rag-ui-3.png)

Refer to the [post installation](docs/post_installation.md) document for batch document ingestion.

## Uninstalling the RAG application

```bash
make uninstall NAMESPACE=llama-stack-rag
```
or

```bash
oc delete project llama-stack-rag
```

## Defining a new model
To deploy a new model using the `llm-service` Helm chart or connect to an existing vLLM server, follow these steps:

1. Deploying a Model via `llm-service`

    If you're deploying the model with `llm-service`, edit the file `deploy/helm/llm-service/values-gpu.yaml` and add a new model definition under the `.models` section to specify the model you want deployed with the `llm-service` chart and its args:
    ```yaml
      models:
        llama-3-2-3b-instruct:
          id: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
          enabled: false
          inferenceService:
            args:
            - --enable-auto-tool-choice
            - --chat-template
            - /vllm-workspace/examples/tool_chat_template_llama3.2_json.jinja
            - --tool-call-parser
            - llama3_json
            - --max-model-len
            - "30544"
    ```

2. Update `llama-stack` Configuration

    Edit the file `deploy/helm/rag-ui/charts/llama-stack/values.yaml` and add a corresponding entry under `.models` for the LLaMA stack configuration.
    ```yaml
      llama-3-2-3b-instruct:
        id: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
        enabled: false
        url: local-ns
    ```

Notes:
* If the model is not deployed with `llm-service` in the same namespace as `llama-stack`, you do not need to modify the `llm-service` values.  Instead, just configure the the external model in `llama-stack` and replace `local-ns` with a url, and an optional `apiToken`.
* To use the new model, set the `enabled` flags to true.


## Local Development Setup

Refer to the [local setup guide](docs/local_setup_guide.md) document for configuring your workstation for code changes and local testing.

1. From the root of the project, switch to the ui directory

```bash
cd ui
```

2. Create a virtual environment (Python based development often works better with a virtual environment)

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Download the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Port forward the service inside of OpenShift to the local machine on port 8321

```bash
oc port-forward svc/llamastack 8321:8321
```

5. Launch the application and opens a browser tab with the `streamlit` command

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

6. Give the weather MCP-based tool a test with a US-based city by toggling on "mcp::weather" via a click for real-time weather information

![RAG UI MCP weather](./docs/img/rag-ui-3.png)

### Redeploy Changes

Make changes to app.py

Deployment after making changes requires a rebuild of the container image using either `docker` or `podman`.  Replace `docker.io` with your target container registry such as `quay.io`.

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t docker.io/burrsutter/rag-ui:v1 -f Containerfile .
```

```bash
docker push docker.io/burrsutter/rag-ui:v1
```

Add modification to `deploy/helm/rag-ui/values.yaml`

```
image:
  repository: docker.io/burrsutter/rag-ui
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: v1
```

 To redeploy to the cluster run the same `make` command as you did before.

### Shields

```bash
export LLAMA_STACK_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8321
```

First see what models are available

```bash
curl -sS $LLAMA_STACK_SERVER/v1/models -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq -r '.data[].identifier'
```

```
(Output)
meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B
all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

The "Guard" model is the one appropriate for adding as a Llama Stack Shield.

From within the `ui` directory or whichever one has the `venv` with the dependencies:

- Register the shield

```
python ../shields/register-shield.py
```

- List shields

```
python ../shields/list-shields.py
```

- Test the shield

```
python ../shields/test-shield.py
```

```
(Output)
LLAMA_STACK_ENDPOINT: http://localhost:8321
LLAMA_STACK_MODEL: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
Safety violation detected: I can't answer that. Can I help with something else?
